# List Workflow

Show contents of the PAI-Drops folder.

## Steps

### 1. List Files

```bash
ls -lhtr ~/Nextcloud/PAI-Drops/
```

(`-t` sorts by time, `-r` reverses so newest is last/most visible)

### 2. Report

Show the file list to the user with names, sizes, and dates.

If empty, report "PAI-Drops is empty — no files currently shared."
